# File Handling - Extracting Even-Odd
A Python program that reads a text file named numbers.txt that contains 20 integers. The program will create two other text files; the first text file will be named even.txt, which will contain all even numbers extracted from numbers.txt. The second text file will be named odd.txt and will contain all odd numbers extracted from numbers.txt.

## Program Instructions

* The user will be asked to input the integers; thus, numbers.txt may be created automatically.
* The output will be written in plain text files that will be created once the program is run, where:
      
        
        - Even integers will be on even.txt.
        - Odd integers will be on odd.txt.
* The outputs will also be displayed in a new window using tkinter. 
      
## Installation
  git bash installation:

      git clone [link]

      cd [project name]

      npm install
      
  Or, to smoothly run the program, install or download the following modules:
  
     * colorama (pip install colorama)
     * tkinter (pip install tk)
     * PIl (pip install Pillow)
  (easiest way to install is through pip)
